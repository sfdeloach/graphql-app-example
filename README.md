Many thanks to [Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/@NetNinja 'pretty awesome guy') for his
[GraphQL Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9iK6Qhn-QLcXCXPQUov1U7f). This
is codebase is not exactly the same as provided in the tutorial:

- [graphql-http](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-http) is used instead of
  [express-graphql](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-graphql)
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) was used to test the API instead of using
  [graphiql](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql)
- ES Modules were used instead of CommonJS Modules
